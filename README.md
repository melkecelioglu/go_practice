**#M1 Simple Web Application Golang Calculator**

Main function sets up two HTTP handlers, one for the root path ("/") and another for the "/result" path. 
The first handler is responsible for rendering the input form, while the second handler processes form submissions and calculates the result. 
When you run the program, it starts an HTTP server that listens on port 8080, and you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to "http://localhost:8080"
Also on html files results can be seen.

**#M2 Golang Chat Application with Websockets**

Perfect for those of you interested in web development and real-time communication. We'll be diving into a chat application written in Go, utilizing the Gorilla WebSocket library and HTML for the frontend. This project allows users to join a chat room and exchange messages in real time. I've broken down the code into three main files: main.go, room.go, and client.go, and I'll also briefly touch upon the chat.html and chat.js files for the HTML and JavaScript components. You can find the video on my YouTube channel.
