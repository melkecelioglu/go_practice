#M1 Simple Web Application Golang Calculator

Main function sets up two HTTP handlers, one for the root path ("/") and another for the "/result" path. 
The first handler is responsible for rendering the input form, while the second handler processes form submissions and calculates the result. 
When you run the program, it starts an HTTP server that listens on port 8080, and you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to "http://localhost:8080"
Also on html files results can be seen.
